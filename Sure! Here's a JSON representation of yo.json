Sure! Here's a JSON representation of your NFT collection "WakeMeUpGoGo" with the first NFT's description:

```json
{
  "collection_name": "WAKE UP!",
  "nfts": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "WakeMeUpGoGo #1",
      "description": "Grumpy, crazy and unpredictable! When this man has to get up 7am Monday morning...",
      "image": "url_to_image_of_NFT1",
      "attributes": {
        "trait1": "Grumpy",
        "trait2": "Crazy",
        "trait3": "Unpredictable"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "WakeMeUpGoGo #2",
      "description": "Description of NFT 2",
      "image": "url_to_image_of_NFT2",
      "attributes": {
        "trait1": "Trait1 of NFT 2",
        "trait2": "Trait2 of NFT 2",
        "trait3": "Trait3 of NFT 2"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "WakeMeUpGoGo #3",
      "description": "Description of NFT 3",
      "image": "url_to_image_of_NFT3",
      "attributes": {
        "trait1": "Trait1 of NFT 3",
        "trait2": "Trait2 of NFT 3",
        "trait3": "Trait3 of NFT 3"
      }
    }
    // Add more NFT objects as needed
  ]
}
```

Replace `"url_to_image_of_NFT1"` with the actual URL of the image for your first NFT, and similarly for other NFTs. You can also add more NFT objects following the same structure provided.
